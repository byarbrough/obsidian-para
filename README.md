# Obsidian PARA

Template for using Obsidian for PARA as your universal organization system.

## What is PARA

> [P.A.R.A.](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) stands for Projects — Areas — Resources — Archives, the four top-level categories that encompass every type of information you might encounter in your work and life. It was designed by Tiago Forte to be a universal organization system.

Each of the four folders is actionable. Projects contain discrete goals with specified time horizons, while Archives may sit dormant for months.

A **project** is “a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.”

Examples include: Complete app mockup; Develop project plan; Execute business development campaign; Write blog post; Finalize product specifications; Attend conference

An **area of responsibility** is “a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.”

Examples include: Health; Finances, Professional Development; Travel; Hobbies; Friends; Apartment; Car; Productivity; Direct reports; Product Development; Writing

A **resource** is “a topic or theme of ongoing interest.”

Examples include: habit formation; project management; transhumanism; coffee; music; gardening; online marketing; SEO; interior design; architecture; note-taking

**Archives** include “inactive items from the other three categories.”

Examples include: projects that have been completed or become inactive; areas that you are no longer committed to maintaining; resources that you are no longer interested in

### Progressive Summarization

PARA intends to enable you to **Remeber**, **Connect**, and **Create**.

You should be able to capture ideas worth saving, opportunistically connect those ideas with other ideas, and then use your curated, layered knowledge base to create content you enjoy and is valuable.

You accomplish this via [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes). This is a strategy that answers the question, "How do I make what I’m consuming right now easily discoverable for my future self?”

The core of Progressive Summarization is that every time you interact with a note, you compress it just a little more. As you compress it, you loose some of the original context, but have the opportunity to connect it with other and new ideas.

For more information, see Forte's [Building a Second Brain Course](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/) and his [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes) post.

## Why Obsidian

> [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful **knowledge base** on top of
a **local folder** of plain text Markdown files.

It is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iPhone.

Here are the key features that make Obsidian the best choice for PARA:

1. **Tags and links are first-class.** The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same. Graph view allows you to explore links.
2. **Never worry about being locked-in.** Files are plain Markdown and stored locally. So if you ever decide to use a different editor, you don't need to hope that you'll be able to export them from a proprietary format.
3. **Beauty and simplicity**. The editor is simple, yet powerful, giving you more space for your thoughts and less for distractions. Plus, with extensible plugins, you can customize it to fit you.
4. **Sync across all your devices.** Seamless synchronization across your computers and mobile devices. The files are encrypted, so only you can read them.

## How to use this repository

First, [download this repository](https://github.com/byarbrough/obsidian-para/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it to where you want your vault to be located.

Consider placing the folder in a location that is automatically backed up, such as to iCloud or GoogleDrive.

If using `git`, then change the `remote` to your repository before using the [obsidian-git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) plugin (which doesn't work with Snaps, sadly)... if that was gibberish, then just delete the `.git/` hidden folder.

### Obsidian Setup

[Install Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Then "Open folder as vault."

![Open folder as vault](images/obsidian-folder-as-vault.png)

Open this folder.

The settings for your vault are saved in the hidden folder `.obsidian/`. Currently, several core plugins are enabled. All community plugins and themes are disabled. You can change this in settings.

Purchasing and setting up [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) is highly recommended if you are using Obsidian on multiple devices.

#### Templates

The `templates/` directory contains templates that can be used to standardize headers in your files.

To insert a template, create a new file, name it, and press `Ctrl + p`. Then begin typing "templates".
