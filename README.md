# Obsidian PARA

Template for using Obsidian for PARA as your universal organization system.

## What is PARA

> [P.A.R.A.](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) stands for Projects — Areas — Resources — Archives, the four top-level categories that encompass every type of information you might encounter in your work and life.

It was designed by Tiago Forte to be a universal organization system.

A **project** is “a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.”

Examples include: Complete app mockup; Develop project plan; Execute business development campaign; Write blog post; Finalize product specifications; Attend conference

An **area of responsibility** is “a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.”

Examples include: Health; Finances, Professional Development; Travel; Hobbies; Friends; Apartment; Car; Productivity; Direct reports; Product Development; Writing

A **resource** is “a topic or theme of ongoing interest.”

Examples include: habit formation; project management; transhumanism; coffee; music; gardening; online marketing; SEO; interior design; architecture; note-taking

**Archives** include “inactive items from the other three categories.”

Examples include: projects that have been completed or become inactive; areas that you are no longer committed to maintaining; resources that you are no longer interested in

## Why Obsidian

> [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful **knowledge base** on top of
a **local folder** of plain text Markdown files.

It is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iPhone.

Here are the key features that make Obsidian the best choice for PARA:

1. **Tags and links are first-class.** The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same. Graph view allows you to explore links.
2. **Never worry about being locked-in.** Files are plain Markdown and stored locally. So if you ever decide to use a different editor, you don't need to hope that you'll be able to export them from a proprietary format.
3. **Beauty and simplicity**. The editor is simple, yet powerful, giving you more space for your thoughts and less for distractions. Plus, with extensible plugins, you can customize it to fit you.
4. **Sync across all your devices.** Seamless synchronization across your computers and mobile devices. The files are encrypted, so only you can read them.
