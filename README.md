Here are the key features that make Obsidian the best choice for PARA:

1. **Tags and links are first-class.** The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same. Graph view allows you to explore links.
2. **Never worry about being locked-in.** Files are plain Markdown and stored locally. So if you ever decide to use a different editor, you don't need to hope that you'll be able to export them from a proprietary format.
3. **Beauty and simplicity**. The editor is simple, yet powerful, giving you more space for your thoughts and less for distractions. Plus, with extensible plugins, you can customize it to fit you.
4. **Sync across all your devices.** Seamless synchronization across your computers and mobile devices. The files are encrypted, so only you can read them.
