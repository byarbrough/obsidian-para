**To Projects**: It is common to start a new project, and realize there is something you’ve been collecting for a long time that is potentially useful to the new project. Maybe you’ve been collecting ideas in a Travel (area) notebook for awhile — when the time comes to plan and schedule a specific trip (a project), this is a great place to start. If you find one travel destination you want to take action on, you can move it to a brand spanking new “Bali” (project) notebook as the seed to get your planning started.

**To Resources**: As mentioned before, it’s a good idea to keep personally relevant information in Areas, and generally useful information in Resources. But sometimes you realize a note you thought was only relevant to you can also provide value to others. For example, I realized my personal time-tracking data, collected over years, might be useful to show others as an example. I moved it to a Quantified Self (resource) notebook so I was sure to see it in the future if I wanted to share useful resources with others.

**To Archives**: Although it is rare, sometimes an area ceases to be active, and can be archived. I helped my dad with his business website for years, an area of responsibility that had an indefinite end date. But eventually I got too busy, and moved that area to Archives. This also applies to relationships, whether work or personal, which don’t usually have an exact end date, but can become inactive after a move or job change (or breakup).
